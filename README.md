# Particle Tracking Challenge

This project is a part of a global Particle Tracking Challenge initiated by CERN (_https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trackml-particle-identification_).

The code is written in Python for Google Colab environment. _Particle_Tracking_Challenge.ipynb_ can be uploaded and compiled there. This file also provides comments and explanations to all key aspects of the code. The core of the project is a reconstruction algorithm that rebuilds particle trajectories based on hit coordinates that they leave in a detector.

This project is completed only partially. The next step would be implementing Machine Learning procedures and making the reconstruction process automatic.
